# Temporary File Usage Check

Monitors PostgreSQL temporary file creation which indicates queries spilling to disk.

> **Note**: Thresholds are tuned for production-scale databases. This check acts as a **regression detector** rather than an absolute health check - it catches significant increases from baseline that indicate query plan regressions, new inefficient queries, or work_mem configuration issues.

## What It Checks

### Temp File Rate (`temp-rate`)

One finding carrying two numbers, the files created and the bytes written. Each is
graded against its own thresholds and the finding reports the worse of the two.

Files created:
- **FAIL**: ≥20 files/hour (serious regression or multiple problematic queries)
- **WARN**: ≥5 files/hour (new inefficient queries or query plan changes)
- **Baseline**: Well-tuned production databases typically see <1 file/hour

Bytes written:
- **FAIL**: ≥5 GB/hour (major regression or multiple large queries spilling to disk)
- **WARN**: ≥1 GB/hour (increased large sorts/hashes from new features or query changes)
- **Baseline**: Well-tuned production databases typically see 100-200MB/hour

`temp-file-sources` below carries the same grade when it can name the statements
responsible. When it cannot, the rate keeps it: a spill nothing accounts for is more
often the worst case than a benign one.

### The Measurement Window

Both numbers are per-hour rates, so they need a period to divide by. That period
runs from `pg_stat_database.stats_reset` — but most databases have never had
`pg_stat_reset()` called, leaving it NULL.

In that case the window is anchored to `pg_postmaster_start_time()` instead. A clean
restart preserves the counters on PostgreSQL 15+, and everything that *does* zero
them (crash, unclean shutdown, a rebuilt replica) happens at a server start. So the
real window is **at least** the uptime, and the rates computed from it are **upper
bounds**:

- A rate below the threshold is conclusive — the true rate is lower still.
- A rate above it might just be a long history divided by a short uptime, so the
  finding is capped at WARN and never escalates to FAIL.

The check reports SKIP only when the window is under an hour, where the denominator
is small enough that a single query's temp file would dominate the rate.

### Top Spilling Statements (`temp-file-sources`)

When the rate finding fires, the check lists the top statements by temp data
written, from `pg_stat_statements`. It is skipped on a healthy database: reading that
view materialises the entire query-text corpus into a `work_mem` tuplestore, which can
itself spill.

**The table does not add up to the rate, by design.** `pg_stat_database.temp_bytes`
measures the *disk footprint* of each temp file, its size when deleted.
`pg_stat_statements.temp_blks_written` measures *write I/O*, and a multi-pass external
sort rewrites the same file once per merge pass. Measured on PostgreSQL 17, one
identical 71 MB sort reports 71 MB, 213 MB or 289 MB of writes depending on
`work_mem`; hash joins and materialised CTEs reconcile 1:1. Rank by the table, never
sum it.

The finding is omitted when nothing can be attributed, since the rate finding has
already reported the problem. `pg_stat_statements` keeps its own counters with their
own reset, so `pg_stat_statements_reset()` empties this table and leaves the rate
untouched. An absent table never means no temp file was written.

Three things are missing from it:

- **Cancelled and failed statements.** `pg_stat_statements` records at `ExecutorEnd`,
  which does not run on abort, but the temp file is still counted by
  `pg_stat_database`. If you use `statement_timeout`, the worst offender may not be
  listed. `log_temp_files` is the only source that catches those.
- **Logical decoding spill** (Debezium and other CDC). Not counted by this check at
  all. See `pg_stat_replication_slots.spill_bytes`.
- **A last-execution time.** `pg_stat_statements` has no last-seen column in any
  version through PostgreSQL 18. "Tracked Since" is when the *entry was created*, not
  when the statement last ran, and it is empty before PostgreSQL 17.

### Investigating

**If the table is empty**, the offenders exist but `pg_stat_statements` cannot see
them, and the rate finding names the reasons it found. This is the query behind that,
if you want the full picture:

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_statements
     WHERE dbid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_database WHERE datname = current_database())
       AND temp_blks_written > 0)                                           AS with_temp,
  (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'pg_stat_statements.track') AS track,
  (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings
     WHERE name = 'pg_stat_statements.track_utility')                       AS track_utility,
  (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'pg_stat_statements.max')   AS max_entries,
  (SELECT dealloc FROM pg_stat_statements_info)                             AS evictions,
  (SELECT stats_reset FROM pg_stat_statements_info)                         AS pgss_reset,
  (SELECT stats_reset FROM pg_stat_database
     WHERE datname = current_database())                                    AS db_stats_reset,
  (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'statement_timeout')        AS statement_timeout,
  (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'log_temp_files')           AS log_temp_files;
```

| Reading | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `statement_timeout` set | A killed query never reaches `ExecutorEnd`, so it is never recorded, while its temp file still counts. Usually the cause, and the offender is an expensive statement by construction |
| `evictions` large | Entries are discarded faster than they accumulate. Each event drops about 5% of `max`, so a large count means the working set of distinct statements far exceeds capacity. Anything infrequent disappears before it can be read, and **every** `pg_stat_statements`-based check is then analysing a truncated sample |
| `track_utility = off` | `CREATE INDEX`, `CLUSTER` and `VACUUM FULL` write sort files and are not recorded |
| `pgss_reset` ≫ `db_stats_reset` | Query stats were reset; the rate kept its history while attribution started over |
| `track = none` | Nothing is being recorded at all |

`log_temp_files = 0` logs every temp file with its size and the statement that wrote
it. It is the only source that sees all of them, and the fallback whenever the table
cannot explain the rate.

**If the top entry is a monitoring query**, it is not a false positive. Reading
`pg_stat_statements` materialises its entire query-text corpus into a `work_mem`
tuplestore before any filter applies, so an agent polling it frequently can become the
largest temp producer on the instance. Check the poll interval and `work_mem` for that
role before looking anywhere else. pgdoctor excludes its own statements from the
table. Other tools' are left in deliberately, since they spill like anything else.

**A high volume rate with a low file rate** means few, very large files: sorts, hash
joins or index builds exceeding `work_mem` by a wide margin, rather than routine
overflow. Divide one by the other for the average file size.

### Verifying a Fix

Because the counters are cumulative and nothing decays, a statement you fixed today
still appears next week with the same totals. To check whether a fix landed, reset
that one statement's entry:

```sql
SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset(
    0,
    (SELECT oid FROM pg_database WHERE datname = current_database()),
    <queryid>);   -- from the table above
```

A targeted reset **deletes** the entry (measured at ~0.4 ms; it touches only the
`pg_stat_statements` hash table). Re-run this check after a full traffic cycle:

- entry still absent: the statement has not run
- entry back with no temp writes: it ran and no longer spills
- entry back at the top: the fix did not land

This needs EXECUTE on `pg_stat_statements_reset`, which is **superuser-only by default
and is not granted to `pg_monitor`**, so a read-only monitoring role cannot do it.

**Do not run `pg_stat_reset()` on a production primary** to clear the headline rate.
It is the only thing that clears `temp_files`/`temp_bytes`, but it also zeroes
`n_dead_tup` and `n_mod_since_analyze` for every table, which are the counters
autovacuum schedules on, so every table's next autovacuum is deferred until the churn
re-accumulates. Compare two runs of this check over a known interval instead.

The two clocks are independent: `pg_stat_statements_reset()` clears the table and
leaves the rate untouched; `pg_stat_reset()` clears the rate and leaves the table.

## Why This Matters

Temporary files are created when PostgreSQL operations exceed `work_mem`:
- **Sorts** - ORDER BY, DISTINCT, merge joins
- **Hash tables** - Hash joins, hash aggregates
- **Bitmap heaps** - Index scans exceeding work_mem

Temp files cause:
- **Slow queries** - Disk I/O is 100x slower than memory
- **Disk pressure** - Competes with WAL, tables, indexes
- **Unpredictable performance** - Depends on disk availability

## How to Fix

### For `temp-rate`

The finding reports both rates, so start with whichever crossed its threshold.

**A high file creation rate** (>5 files/hour) indicates queries spilling to disk. Fix by increasing work_mem or optimizing queries:

**Option 1: Increase work_mem globally (use with caution)**
```sql
-- Calculate safe value: (Available RAM * 0.25) / max_connections
-- Example for 32GB RAM, 200 connections: (32 * 0.25) / 200 = 40MB
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '40MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

**Option 2: Set work_mem per-role (safer)**
```sql
-- Give analytics/reporting users more memory
ALTER ROLE analytics_user SET work_mem = '256MB';

-- Keep application users at default
ALTER ROLE app_user SET work_mem = '16MB';
```

**Option 3: Optimize problematic queries**
```sql
-- Enable logging to identify queries creating temp files
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_temp_files = 10240;  -- Log temp files >10MB
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Query pg_stat_statements to find offenders
-- temp_blks_written is write I/O, not disk footprint: a multi-pass external sort
-- rewrites the same file, so this can exceed the bytes the file ever occupied.
SELECT query, calls, temp_blks_written,
       pg_size_pretty(temp_blks_written * current_setting('block_size')::bigint) AS temp_written
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE temp_blks_written > 0
ORDER BY temp_blks_written DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Then optimize queries: add indexes, rewrite joins, limit result sets
```

**A high data volume** (>1GB/hour) indicates large sorts/hashes spilling to disk:

**Option 1: Increase work_mem (same as above)**

**Option 2: Optimize large queries**
```sql
-- Find queries writing large temp files
SELECT query, calls, temp_blks_written,
       pg_size_pretty(temp_blks_written * 8192) AS temp_size
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE temp_blks_written > 0
ORDER BY temp_blks_written DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Common optimizations:
-- 1. Add indexes to reduce sort/hash operations
-- 2. Use LIMIT/pagination for large result sets
-- 3. Avoid ORDER BY on large datasets when not needed
-- 4. Use partial indexes for filtered queries
-- 5. Consider materialized views for expensive aggregations
```

**Option 3: Use maintenance_work_mem for maintenance operations**
```sql
-- If VACUUM/REINDEX causing temp files, increase maintenance_work_mem
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

## work_mem Tuning

`work_mem` is allocated **per operation**, not per connection. A single complex query can use many work_mem allocations.

### Safe Formula for RDS
```
work_mem = (Available RAM * 0.25) / max_connections
```

Example for db.r5.xlarge (32GB RAM, 200 connections):
```sql
-- (32GB * 0.25) / 200 = 40MB
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '40MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

### Per-Role Settings (Safer)
```sql
ALTER ROLE analytics_user SET work_mem = '256MB';
ALTER ROLE app_user SET work_mem = '16MB';
```

## Debugging Temp Files

### Enable Logging
```sql
-- Log all temp files >10MB
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_temp_files = 10240;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

### Query pg_stat_statements
```sql
-- temp_blks_written is write I/O, not disk footprint: a multi-pass external sort
-- rewrites the same file, so this can exceed the bytes the file ever occupied.
SELECT query, calls, temp_blks_written,
       pg_size_pretty(temp_blks_written * current_setting('block_size')::bigint) AS temp_written
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE temp_blks_written > 0
ORDER BY temp_blks_written DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
