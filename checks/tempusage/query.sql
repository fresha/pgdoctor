-- name: TempUsage :one
-- Monitors temporary file creation indicating work_mem exhaustion
-- Most databases have never had pg_stat_reset() called, so stats_reset is NULL and
-- there is no recorded start for the window. The counters are still accumulating
-- normally, so fall back to the server start time: a clean restart preserves them
-- (PG15+), and the events that do zero them - crash, unclean shutdown, a rebuilt
-- replica - all coincide with a start. The true window is therefore at least the
-- uptime, which makes the rates below upper bounds rather than exact.
