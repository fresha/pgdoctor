-- name: LargeTables :many
-- Identifies all large tables (>= min_table_rows) and large partitions (>= min_partition_rows) with partitioning and transient status.
-- Returns both regular and partitioned tables for unified analysis.
-- Includes activity metrics (inserts/updates/deletes) as context for each table.
