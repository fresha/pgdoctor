## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-27

Tracks upstream [emancu/pgdoctor v0.6.0](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/releases/tag/v0.6.0): typed per-check config, new `run` exit codes, re-tiered severities, and two renamed IDs. This release has breaking changes.

**Breaking changes**

- **Exit codes**: `run` exits `1` only when a check reports FAIL, for text and JSON output. It exits `2` when it cannot run: a connection error, a usage error, an invalid `--config`, or zero checks selected ([#133](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/133), [#148](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/148)).
- **Renamed IDs**: `statistics-freshness` is now `db-statistics` ([#97](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/97)), and the `toast-storage/toast-storage` finding is now `toast-storage/toast-usage` ([#152](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/152)).
- **Severities**: `partitioning`, `connection-health/long-idle` and `connection-health/pool-pressure` no longer FAIL. `pk-types` and `sequence-health` use WARN 50% / FAIL 90% for int2/int4 capacity. Physical replication lag is WARN at 5 s and FAIL at 60 s. `idle-in-transaction` fails at 1 h. See Changed for the details.
- **Config**: typed per-check config. New YAML shapes, and a new `check.Config` for library callers. `session-settings` drops the `roles` allow list for `ignore_roles`. See Changed.
- **Library**: the generated `db` types change for `invalid-indexes`, `table-activity`, `pk-types`, `partitioning`, `table-seq-scans`, `sequence-health` and `connection-health` (listed in each entry below).

### Added

- **CLI**: `run --config <file>` reads per-check settings from YAML ([#99](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/99), [#102](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/102)).
- **Config keys**: new per-check settings. Each check README lists its keys:
  - `session-settings`: `timeout_by_role` ([#98](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/98)), `ignore_roles` ([#187](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/187))
  - `table-vacuum-health`: `ignore_tables` ([#100](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/100))
  - `partitioning`: `inefficient_partitions_min_rows`, `large_unpartitioned_min_rows`, `transient_unpartitioned_min_rows` ([#149](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/149), [#177](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/177))
  - `pk-types`, `sequence-health`: `usage_warn_percent`, `usage_fail_percent` ([#174](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/174), [#179](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/179))
  - `replication-lag`: `physical_lag_warn_seconds`, `physical_lag_fail_seconds`, and `physical_lag_by_application` for one replica ([#176](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/176))
  - `connection-health`: `long_idle_warn_count` ([#178](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/178))
  - `table-seq-scans`: `high_seq_scans_min_rows`, `high_seq_scans_min_ratio` ([#175](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/175))
- **`connection-health`**: new `stats-restricted` WARN when the role cannot see other roles' connections ([#92](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/92)).
- **`sequence-health`**: the `integer-columns` table shows `FKs`, the number of foreign keys that reference the column ([#165](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/165)).

### Changed

- **CLI**: an invalid `--config` stops the run before any query and lists every error ([#148](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/148)).
- **CLI**: an unknown `--only` or `--ignore` value is an error, not a warning ([#133](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/133)).
- **CLI**: `--detail verbose` and `--detail debug` show the details of PASS findings ([#138](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/138)).
- **CLI**: bytes under 1 KiB print as `512 bytes`, so `B` means only billions (`2.1B`). A missing table cell shows `-`, and the summary uses correct plurals ([#162](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/162)).
- **Library**: `Run` reads the server version from the database when the caller's `InstanceMetadata` has none ([#131](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/131)).
- **Config**: each configurable check exports `Config`, `DefaultConfig()` and `Validate()`, and `check.Config` holds those values. Lists and maps are real YAML, an unknown key fails at any depth, warn >= fail is an error and no longer falls back to the defaults, and the library `Run` reports SKIP for an invalid value ([#187](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/187)).
- **checktest**: `AssertSeverityInvariant` accepts a table row that is more severe than its finding ([#142](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/142)).
- **Docs**: every finding ID that can be INFO, WARN or FAIL has a `### For \`finding-id\`` heading in its check README, and a test enforces it ([#163](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/163)).
- **Release**: release binaries build with the latest stable Go. `go.mod` keeps `go 1.25.0` and adds `toolchain go1.27.1`, and CI tests Go 1.25-1.27 with golangci-lint v2.14 ([#170](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/170), [#182](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/182)).
- **`connection-health`**: `long-idle` and `pool-pressure` are WARN only. `idle-in-transaction` measures idle time from `state_change`, with WARN at 5 min and FAIL at 1 h. Library: `db.IdleInTransactionRow` has `IdleDurationSeconds` and no `TimeoutMs` ([#178](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/178)).
- **`db-statistics`**: renamed from `statistics-freshness` ([#97](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/97)).
- **`duplicate-indexes`**, **`table-seq-scans`**: every object is listed in a table, not at most 10 in `Details` ([#161](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/161)).
- **`invalid-indexes`**, **`table-activity`**: tables show one schema-qualified `Table` column. Library: `db.BrokenIndexesRow` and `db.TableActivityRow` change ([#89](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/89), [#90](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/90)).
- **`partitioning`**: `large-unpartitioned` (50M rows) and `transient-unpartitioned` (10M rows) are WARN, not FAIL. Library: `db.Queries.LargeTables` takes `db.LargeTablesParams` ([#149](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/149), [#177](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/177)).
- **`pk-types`**: WARN at 50% and FAIL at 90% of key capacity, instead of 45% and 85%. A row that uses the row estimate is WARN at most ([#174](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/174)).
- **`replication-lag`**: physical lag is WARN at 5 s and FAIL at 60 s, instead of 250 ms and 1 s. The logical absolute tier is WARN only ([#176](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/176)).
- **`sequence-health`**: WARN at 50% and FAIL at 90% for int2/int4. `integer-columns` measures the column, so it catches an int4 column fed by a bigint sequence. `type-mismatch` takes its severity from the column usage. Library: `db.SequenceHealthRow` changes ([#179](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/179)).
- **`table-seq-scans`**: a table with no index scans shows `no index scans` as its ratio. Library: `db.Queries.HighSeqScanTables` takes `minRows` ([#175](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/175)).
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `autovacuum-disabled` lists one row per table ([#88](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/88)).
- **`toast-storage`**: the finding for no significant TOAST storage is renamed `toast-usage` ([#152](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/152)).

### Fixed

- **CLI**: the report header no longer shows the password of a keyword connection string ([#103](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/103)).
- **CLI**: `run` uses a 10 s connect timeout and `application_name=pgdoctor` unless the connection string sets them ([#139](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/139)).
- **CLI**: a `--preset` other than `all` takes precedence over `--only`, and an unknown preset prints a warning ([#135](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/135)).
- **CLI**: `--only` and `--ignore` accept the `category/check-id` form that `list` prints ([#140](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/140)).
- **CLI**: `--hide-passing` hides only PASS. It prints no empty category headers, and the summary matches the headers ([#145](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/145)).
- **CLI**: `--config` accepts the `partitioning` settings ([#172](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/172)).
- **Release**: the binary version no longer ends in `+dirty`, and pgx, x/net, x/text and goldmark are bumped to fix govulncheck findings ([#144](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/144)).
- **`connection-efficiency`**, **`replication-slots`**: the standalone CLI knows the server version, so `connection-efficiency` runs and `replication-slots` uses the query for that version ([#131](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/131)).
- **`duplicate-indexes`**: `prefix-duplicates` reports prefix pairs. It never matched before. It skips unique, exclusion and `INCLUDE` indexes, and pairs that differ in access method, operator class, collation or sort order ([#132](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/132)).
- **`index-usage`**, **`partition-usage`**: a finding that cannot be computed reports SKIP, not PASS or WARN. With no stats reset recorded, `low-usage-indexes` uses the server uptime as its window ([#143](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/143)).
- **`index-usage`**: `unused-indexes` says that scan counts cover this instance only, so confirm 0 scans on every node before you drop an index ([#184](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/184)).
- **`index-usage`**, **`cache-efficiency`**, **`table-seq-scans`**, **`table-vacuum-health`**: read every non-system schema, not only `public` ([#93](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/94), [#95](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/95), [#96](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/96)).
- **`partition-usage`**: the README verifies pruning with `EXPLAIN` and real values, not `EXPLAIN (GENERIC_PLAN)` ([#186](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/186)).
- **`pk-types`**: finds a key's sequence by OID, so IDENTITY keys are reported and a same-named sequence in another schema no longer supplies the value. About 100 ms at 10,000 tables, where it exceeded the statement timeout. Library: `db.InvalidPrimaryKeyTypesRow` uses plain types ([#136](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/136)).
- **`pk-types`**, **`sequence-health`**: a sequence that the role cannot read no longer counts as 0% used. `sequence-health` reports SKIP or an INFO note, and `pk-types` notes the tables that use the row estimate ([#146](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/146)).
- **`pg-version`**, **`toast-storage`**: PostgreSQL 14 is the support floor. `toast-storage` reports SKIP on PostgreSQL 13, and `pg-version` reports 13 as past end of life ([#150](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/150)).
- **`query-stats-capacity`**: the zero-eviction PASS shows its window, for example `no evictions in 30d` ([#185](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/185)).
- **`replication-slots`**: an inactive slot is also graded on its WAL lag ([#147](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/147)).
- **`sequence-health`**: usage follows the direction of the sequence, and a full-range bigint sequence no longer fails the check with `bigint out of range` ([#167](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/167)).
- **`table-bloat`**: wasted space is estimated from the heap size (`pg_class.relpages`), not from the total size with indexes and TOAST ([#164](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/164)).
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `autovacuum-disabled` reports every spelling of false (`off`, `0`, …), not only `false` ([#137](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/137)).
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `large-table-defaults` computes the trigger from the effective settings (per-table over server, PostgreSQL 18 cap), and skips partitioned parents and tables on a tuned server scale factor ([#166](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/166)).
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: a partitioned parent shows `-` for its size, not a negative value ([#171](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/171)).
- **`toast-storage`**: `toast-bloat` reads TOAST dead tuples from `pg_stat_all_tables`, so it no longer always reports PASS ([#134](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/134)).
- **`uuid-defaults`**: a partitioned table, or a column in several indexes, reports once ([#91](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/91)).
- **`uuid-types`**: table rows report WARN, the same as their finding ([#87](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/87)).
- **`vacuum-settings`**: findings are named "High …" or "Low …", not "Default …" ([#151](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/151)).
- **`vacuum-settings`**: `maintenance_work_mem` no longer reports FAIL with a `+Inf%` budget when the memory size is unknown ([#131](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/131)).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-18

### Changed

- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `autovacuum-disabled` reports one table row per table (Table, Rows, Size, Dead Tuples, Last Vacuum, worst first by dead tuples) instead of a comma-joined sentence in `Details`, matching its sibling subchecks. A consumer can now act on or suppress a single table; `Details` carries only the count.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-14

Tracks upstream [emancu/pgdoctor v0.5.0](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/releases/tag/v0.5.0): read-replica awareness in `InstanceMetadata`, a `pg_stat_statements` version policy, and four check fixes — most notably `work_mem`, which no longer fails pooled instances on a `max_connections` ceiling they never approach.

### Added

- **check**: `InstanceMetadata` gains `IsReadReplica`, populated by the caller like every other field, so a check that is inapplicable on a physical read replica can scope itself instead of reporting a primary-only expectation as a failure ([#78](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/78)).
- **`extension-versions`**: `pg_stat_statements` gains a version policy — WARN below 1.9, the floor `partition-usage`, `temp-usage` and `query-stats-capacity` read against ([#74](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/74)).

### Fixed

- **cli**: the summary's `N info` tally counts again. It switched on report severity, which a `SeverityInfo` finding never raises above PASS, so the branch was unreachable and information-only checks were tallied as passing ([#72](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/72)).
- **cli**: informational findings leave the per-check `(passed/total)` counter on both sides — they have nothing to pass or fail, so a healthy `cache-efficiency` read `(1/3)` ([#72](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/72)).
- **`sequence-health`**: a database with no sequences now reports PASS instead of WARN — a UUID primary-key schema has nothing to check, which is not a defect ([#76](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/76)).
- **`table-bloat`**: a database with quote-requiring table names reports bloat again instead of nothing at all. Sizes came from `pg_total_relation_size(schemaname || '.' || relname)`, whose text→`regclass` cast down-folds the identifier, so `public."Email"` was looked up as `public.email` and raised `42P01` — one such table lost the whole instance's results. Sizes now come from `relid` ([#75](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/75)).
- **`partition-usage`, `temp-usage`, `query-stats-capacity`**: an instance running `pg_stat_statements` below 1.9 was reported as "not available" when the extension was installed and reading fine — `pg_stat_statements_info`, which the shared probe tests for, only exists from 1.9, and major-version upgrades do not run `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE`. The checks now say "unavailable or outdated"; `extension-versions` reports which ([#73](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/73)).
- **`vacuum-settings`**: `work_mem` is graded on the backends actually connected instead of `work_mem × max_connections`, which behind a pooler is a ceiling nobody approaches — a healthy 256GB instance reported 305% of RAM while its backends saturated 11%, burying genuinely undersized small instances in the same bucket. The worst case is still reported as context. Grading on the reachable number also points at the knob an operator can turn: `work_mem` is reload-only, `max_connections` needs a restart ([#80](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/80)).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-08

Tracks upstream [emancu/pgdoctor v0.4.0](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/releases/tag/v0.4.0): the severity rework — an informational `INFO` tier plus a fleet-wide re-tiering of findings that were alerting on workload characteristics rather than defects — two new checks, and the freeze-age, vacuum, partition-usage and temp-usage reworks.

Breaking for library consumers: `SeverityOK` is renamed `SeverityPass`, and several finding IDs are retired (`connection-efficiency/busy-ratio`, `index-usage/index-cache-ratio`, `table-bloat/stale-vacuum`, `table-vacuum-health/analyze-needed`, `toast-storage/large-toast`, `toast-storage/wide-columns`, `temp-usage/temp-file-rate`, `temp-usage/temp-volume-rate`, `index-bloat/high-bloat`, `index-bloat/large-bloat`).

### Added

- **check**: new `SeverityInfo` level for informational findings that never escalate a report's severity. ([emancu/pgdoctor#19](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/19))
- **`extension-versions`**: new check inventorying installed extensions — `version-support` flags versions unsupported upstream (WARN deprecated, FAIL unsupported) against embedded floors for `pg_partman` and `postgis`, and `pending-update` warns when an installed version trails the version bundled on disk. ([emancu/pgdoctor#46](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/46))
- **`query-stats-capacity`**: new check reporting `pg_stat_statements` entry usage against `pg_stat_statements.max`, and grading eviction volume as a daily multiple of capacity — WARN above 0.5x/day, the point where `partition-usage` and `temp-usage` are analysing a truncated sample. Rate-based, never the raw `dealloc` count. ([emancu/pgdoctor#69](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/69))
- **`cache-efficiency`**: new informational `table-cache-ratio` finding listing hot tables (top-20 by reads or ≥1% of read traffic, and ≥10,000 reads) over 500MB with a heap cache-hit ratio below 75%. ([emancu/pgdoctor#37](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/37))
- **`freeze-age`**: new `horizon-pin` finding — reports whether a replication slot's `xmin`/`catalog_xmin` or a prepared transaction is holding the xmin horizon, so a high freeze age tells you whether to drop one object or tune autovacuum. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`freeze-age`**: new `database-multixact-age` and `table-multixact-age` findings covering the MultiXact counter, which wraps independently of transaction IDs and has no RDS CloudWatch metric. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`partition-usage`**: new `query-text-restricted` finding — warns when `pg_stat_statements` hides query text from the current role, instead of reporting PASS on a partial workload. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: new `extension-unavailable` finding — warns when `pg_stat_statements` is installed but unreadable (library not preloaded, or the extension in a schema outside `search_path`), instead of skipping the whole check on a leaked driver error. ([emancu/pgdoctor#62](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/62))
- **`temp-usage`**: new informational `temp-file-sources` finding naming the top statements by temp data written, shown only once a rate finding has fired. ([emancu/pgdoctor#63](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/63))
- **`toast-storage`**: new `compression-default` finding — warns when the cluster `default_toast_compression` is not lz4. ([emancu/pgdoctor#41](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/41))
- **`check.Table`**: new optional `MaxRowsBrief` field overriding the renderer's 10-row cap at the default detail level; column widths are now sized from the rows actually shown, so a long value in a hidden row no longer stretches the table. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))

### Changed

- **check**: renamed `SeverityOK` to `SeverityPass` — breaking for library consumers. ([emancu/pgdoctor#19](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/19))
- **cli**: five findings now carry their result in their own name, which renders at every severity — `cache-efficiency/cache-hit-ratio`, `connection-health/connection-saturation`, `statistics-freshness`, `connection-efficiency` and `table-activity`. Renderers drop a finding's details at PASS, so the number a passing check computed used to be thrown away. ([emancu/pgdoctor#65](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/65))
- **`cache-efficiency`**: `cache-hit-ratio` is now informational, never escalates the report, and reports only below a 60% cache-hit ratio. ([emancu/pgdoctor#16](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/16), [emancu/pgdoctor#37](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/37))
- **`cache-efficiency`**: `index-cache-ratio` moved here from `index-usage` and is now informational — the old `index-usage/index-cache-ratio` finding ID is retired. It lists only hot indexes (top-20 by scans or ≥1% of scan traffic, and ≥10,000 scans) over 500MB with a cache-hit ratio below 75%. ([emancu/pgdoctor#34](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/34), [emancu/pgdoctor#37](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/37))
- **`connection-efficiency`**: `sessions-abandoned` warns above 7% and no longer reports FAIL. ([emancu/pgdoctor#47](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/47))
- **`connection-health`**: `long-idle` now counts connections idle over 1 hour (was 30 minutes) and tiers relative to `max_connections` — WARN above 10%, FAIL above 25% — so pooled warm floors no longer misfire as leaks. ([emancu/pgdoctor#48](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/48))
- **`freeze-age`**: thresholds derive from the effective anti-wraparound trigger instead of hardcoded 400M/800M — WARN at `2 ×` it, FAIL at `min(4 ×, vacuum_failsafe_age)`. A relation's age peaks at its trigger, so the old 150M warning fired on healthy instances. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`freeze-age`**: `table-freeze-age` reports one row per VACUUM target, folding TOAST relations into the parent they are vacuumed through, and states age as a multiple of the trigger rather than a percentage. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`freeze-age`**: covers `relkind IN ('r','m','t')` in every schema, up from `'r'` in `public` — which is what makes an abandoned logical slot's `catalog_xmin` pin on `pg_catalog` visible. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`index-bloat`**: `high-bloat` and `large-bloat` merged into the check's single finding; both old finding IDs are retired. ([emancu/pgdoctor#23](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/23))
- **`index-bloat`**: the bloat-percent arm now also requires an index of at least 200MB, so sub-200MB indexes are listed only when wasting >=2GiB — too little reclaimable space to justify a REINDEX otherwise. ([emancu/pgdoctor#49](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/49))
- **`index-usage`**: `unused-indexes` reports only indexes over 500MB and discloses the statistics window. ([emancu/pgdoctor#34](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/34))
- **`index-usage`**: `low-usage-indexes` flags sustained low read rates instead of lifetime scan counts, and is now informational — acting on it safely requires cluster-wide verification. ([emancu/pgdoctor#34](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/34), [emancu/pgdoctor#38](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/38))
- **`partition-usage`**: partition pruning is now judged per strategy — HASH and LIST need equality on the key (HASH on every key column), RANGE needs its leading column — and queries qualified by another schema are no longer attributed to a same-named table. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: `partition-key-unused` now counts a partition key constrained anywhere after `FROM`, including `JOIN ... ON` conditions, instead of only in `WHERE`. Such queries prune whenever the planner parameterizes the partitioned side, and reporting them buried the genuinely unprunable ones. The finding is also renamed to "Queries Missing Partition Key", matching its `join-missing-partition-key` sibling. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: `partition-key-unused` now reports one row per offending statement — table, calls, total time, `queryid` and clipped text — instead of one aggregate row per table, so a finding can be investigated without querying `pg_stat_statements` by hand. Per-table totals moved above the table and are always shown; the statement list is capped at three by default and complete under `--detail verbose`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: statements are now sampled on two axes — the top 500 by `total_exec_time` plus the top 500 by `calls` — instead of the costliest 500 only. The old cut systematically dropped cheap high-frequency statements, precisely where a missing partition filter compounds at scale, so tables whose unprunable workload is high-volume rather than slow can now be reported. ([emancu/pgdoctor#43](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/43))
- **`pk-types`**: reports int4/int2 primary keys only from 45% capacity usage, FAIL from 85%. ([emancu/pgdoctor#31](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/31))
- **`session-settings`**: caps at WARN — timeout and logging misconfigurations are urgent WARNs, not FAILs; the two-tier thresholds collapse into a single `timeout` (5000ms). ([emancu/pgdoctor#53](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/53))
- **`table-activity`**: `high-churn-tables` and `low-hot-ratio` are now informational and no longer escalate the report — both describe workload characteristics rather than defects. ([emancu/pgdoctor#51](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/51))
- **`table-bloat`**: `large-bloated-tables` now caps at WARN — large-table bloat is chronic wasted disk, not an outage. ([emancu/pgdoctor#52](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/52))
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `vacuum-stale` now lists only tables with real pending work and covers analyze staleness too. ([emancu/pgdoctor#27](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/27))
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: `large-table-defaults` now shows when default settings would next trigger autovacuum, and no longer reports FAIL. ([emancu/pgdoctor#28](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/28))
- **`temp-usage`**: `temp-file-rate` and `temp-volume-rate` merged into one `temp-rate` finding carrying both numbers — they graded one condition and printed two WARN lines. Thresholds are unchanged and still graded independently. ([emancu/pgdoctor#67](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/67))
- **`toast-storage`**: merged `toast-ratio` and `large-toast` into one informational `toast-ratio` finding listing TOAST-heavy tables (>=50% ratio or >=10GB), sorted by TOAST size desc; it never escalates the report. ([emancu/pgdoctor#41](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/41))
- **`toast-storage`**: `compression-algorithm` now counts effective pglz (explicit, or unset while `default_toast_compression` is pglz) and moves its big-TOAST itemization to `--detail debug`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#41](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/41))
- **`uuid-defaults`**: `random-uuid-indexed` states that random v4 defaults "cause" index bloat, dropping the "may cause" hedge. ([emancu/pgdoctor#54](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/54))
- **`vacuum-settings`**: RAM-budget findings are now a single line; the full breakdown moved to `--detail debug`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#21](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/21))
- **docs**: `toast-storage`, `index-usage`, and `cache-efficiency` READMEs restructured to the standard section layout. ([emancu/pgdoctor#55](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/55))

### Fixed

- **`index-usage`**, **`partition-usage`**, **`table-vacuum-health`**: statistics windows are measured on the server (`now() - <ts>`) instead of subtracting a server timestamp from the CLI host's clock. Host skew landed in the window, which moved the `low-usage-indexes` rate test and the 7-day/25-day vacuum cutoffs — the same database could grade differently per operator. ([emancu/pgdoctor#68](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/68))
- **`statistics-freshness`**: warned about an explicit `pg_stat_reset()` — the one event an operator caused deliberately — while reporting "never reset" after a crash or rebuilt replica silently zeroed every counter. With no reset recorded it now anchors to `pg_postmaster_start_time()` as a lower bound on the counter window, so a recently restarted server warns and a long-running one states how much history it has. ([emancu/pgdoctor#58](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/58))
- **`temp-usage`**: reported a bare PASS on every database with no recorded `pg_stat_reset()` — most of a fleet — because its rate guard read a NULL `stats_reset` as a zero-length window. Rates are now measured over server uptime when no reset is recorded (an upper bound, so a PASS is conclusive), and the check SKIPs with a reason when the window is genuinely unusable. ([emancu/pgdoctor#56](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/56), [emancu/pgdoctor#61](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/61))
- **`freeze-age`**: `database-freeze-age` reports the connected database only. `template0`, `template1` and `postgres` cannot be vacuumed from this connection. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`freeze-age`**, **`table-vacuum-health`**: relation size is a lock-free `relpages` estimate. `pg_total_relation_size()` takes an `AccessShareLock` that queues behind waiting DDL, so both checks timed out during the pile-up they exist to diagnose. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **`index-usage`**: `low-usage-indexes` now requires at least one scan, so zero-scan indexes are reported only by `unused-indexes` instead of by both findings. ([emancu/pgdoctor#50](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/50))
- **`table-bloat`**: `stale-vacuum` FAIL is now a strict subset of WARN, reports escalate correctly, and `high-dead-tuples` no longer reports FAIL. ([emancu/pgdoctor#20](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/20))
- **`partition-usage`**: sub-partitioned tables are measured from their leaf partitions. `pg_total_relation_size()` returns 0 for an intermediate `PARTITION BY` node and such nodes carry no `pg_stat_user_tables` counters, so a multi-level parent reported 0 bytes and 0 scans — `high-seq-scan-ratio` could never fire for it and results were ordered by a size that was mostly missing. `Partitions` now counts leaves, not direct children. ([emancu/pgdoctor#43](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/43))
- **`partition-usage`**: `partition-key-unused` now states the period its call and time totals cover — `pg_stat_statements` counters are cumulative since the last reset, so the numbers were uninterpretable on their own. ([emancu/pgdoctor#43](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/43))
- **`partition-usage`**: analyzes complete `pg_stat_statements` query text (current database, top-level statements only), matches tables and partition keys on SQL identifier boundaries, and requires a pruning-capable comparison — partition-leaf queries, lookalike column names, and `ORDER BY`-only key mentions no longer skew results. ([emancu/pgdoctor#25](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/25))
- **`partition-usage`**: a plain `UPDATE` is analyzed again — it has no `FROM` clause, so scanning only after `FROM` reported every update regardless of its `WHERE`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: `LIST` partitions now count inequalities as pruning, matching PostgreSQL, which excludes partitions whose listed values cannot satisfy the predicate. Only `HASH` requires equality on every key column. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: a subquery that scans the target table keeps its predicate, so `FROM (SELECT … FROM orders WHERE created_at = $1) o` is no longer reported; subqueries on other tables are still ignored. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: schema scoping handles independently quoted identifiers, so `tenant_a."orders"` is attributed to `tenant_a` and not to a sibling schema. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: a CTE wrapping an `INSERT` no longer slips past the statement-type filter. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`partition-usage`**: no longer reports `INSERT` statements as missing the partition key. Statement type is matched on the leading keyword, where before `ILIKE '%UPDATE%'` accepted every insert carrying an `updated_at` column — which on Rails and Ecto schemas meant the highest-traffic writes on every partitioned table. ([emancu/pgdoctor#32](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/32))
- **`connection-health`**: README no longer suggests a set-valued `pg_terminate_backend(...)` over `pg_stat_activity` — a mass kill against a live primary. ([emancu/pgdoctor#60](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/60))
- **docs**: `gendocs` removes generated pages for checks that no longer exist, and CI fails on an orphan — `docs/index.html` kept serving a removed check's page. ([emancu/pgdoctor#57](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/57))

### Removed

- **`connection-efficiency`**: retired the `busy-ratio` finding — a point-in-time active/total ratio is meaningless under transaction pooling; `connection-health/idle-ratio` covers the signal. ([emancu/pgdoctor#47](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/47))
- **`table-bloat`**: retired the `stale-vacuum` finding — vacuum freshness is covered by `table-vacuum-health/vacuum-stale`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#26](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/26))
- **`table-vacuum-health`**: retired the `analyze-needed` finding — absorbed by `vacuum-stale`. ([emancu/pgdoctor#27](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/27))
- **`toast-storage`**: retired the `large-toast` finding — absorbed by the merged `toast-ratio`; its ID and 10GB/100GB WARN/FAIL tiers are gone. ([emancu/pgdoctor#41](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/41))
- **`toast-storage`**: retired the `wide-columns` finding — it measured stored width (a TOAST pointer for large values) and could not detect wide columns. ([emancu/pgdoctor#45](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/45))

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-01

Tracks upstream [emancu/pgdoctor v0.3.0](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/releases/tag/v0.3.0): check-correctness fixes and noise reduction, so the doctor reports the value a role actually gets on connect and stops alerting on benign CDC/idle patterns.

### Added

- **`invalid-indexes`**: classifies abandoned `_ccnew`/`_ccold` leftovers from a cancelled `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` as a droppable `leftover` (shown in a `Type` column), distinct from genuinely-broken indexes. ([emancu/pgdoctor#13](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/13), closes [emancu/pgdoctor#12](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/12))
- **`replication-lag`**: capacity-relative signal for logical slots — compares the backlog against `max_slot_wal_keep_size` (≥50% warn, ≥85% fail), firing before Postgres flips `wal_status` to `unreserved`. Disabled when the cap is unlimited (`-1`, the RDS default). ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))
- **`check.ParseDurationMs`**: exported helper that parses GUC duration values (`2000ms`, `2s`, `1min`, `1.5s`, bare numbers, `-1`/`0` sentinels) to milliseconds. ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))

### Changed

- **`invalid-indexes`**: excludes indexes a live `CREATE`/`REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is still building (they are invalid only until the build completes), removing false positives during concurrent builds. ([emancu/pgdoctor#13](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/13))
- **`session-settings`**: encodes the full `pg_db_role_setting` precedence (`role+db > role > db > ALTER ROLE ALL > reset_val`), so the reported value matches what a role actually gets on connect. ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))
- **`connection-health`** idle ratio: now advisory — warns at ≥90% idle with no FAIL tier (genuine exhaustion is already covered by `connection-saturation` and `pool-pressure`). ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))
- **`replication-lag`** (logical): WARN/FAIL now require both sustained lag time **and** a material backlog (≥120s + ≥550 MiB to warn; ≥300s + ≥2 GiB to fail), so Debezium's ack cadence alone no longer trips alerts. Physical replication unchanged. ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))

### Fixed

- **`session-settings`**: unit-aware parsing of timeout values like `2000ms`/`1min` that previously crashed and skipped the entire check; `transaction_timeout` (PG17+) is now skipped on older versions instead of reporting a false `MUST be set` failure. ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))
- **`--detail debug`**: renders `Finding.Debug` for single-finding checks (previously only shown for multi-finding checks). ([emancu/pgdoctor#11](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/11), closes [emancu/pgdoctor#9](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/issues/9))

### Removed

- Orphaned `MissingProviderIdTables` generated query (no corresponding check existed). ([emancu/pgdoctor#10](https://github.com/emancu/pgdoctor/pull/10))

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Streaming output**: results print as each check completes instead of batching, with category headers preserved.
- **Per-check timing**: visible with `--detail verbose` or `--detail debug`. Total timing always shown in summary.
- **`SeveritySkip`**: checks that fail to run (timeout, permission error) are reported as `[SKIP]` with the reason, instead of aborting the entire run.
- **`Filter()` function**: public API to filter checks by ID or category before execution.
- **`ReportHandler` type** and **`Collect()` helper**: clean callback-based API for consuming check results.
- **`Options` struct**: replaces long parameter list in `Run()` for better readability and extensibility.
- **`statement_timeout`**: uses PostgreSQL-level timeout per query instead of Go context timeout, keeping the connection healthy after slow queries.

### Changed

- **Default detail level** changed from `summary` to `brief` (shows subchecks and details for non-passing checks).
- **`Run()` API redesign**: accepts `Options` struct with callback, no error return. Check errors become `SeveritySkip` reports.
- **`SeverityOK.String()`** returns `"pass"` instead of `"ok"` (4-char alignment: pass/warn/fail/skip).
- **`vacuum-settings` check** no longer skips entirely without instance metadata — runs all non-RAM-dependent checks (scale factors, cost settings, critical misconfigurations).

### Removed

- `Run()` no longer accepts `only`/`ignored` parameters directly — use `Filter()` before calling `Run()`.
