# TOAST Storage Analysis Check

Analyzes PostgreSQL TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) usage to identify storage inefficiencies, performance issues, and schema design problems.

## Why This Matters

TOAST storage issues compound over time and impact multiple aspects of your database:

- **Storage costs**: TOAST overhead can increase storage by 20-40% for tables with large values
- **Query performance**: Fetching TOASTed values requires additional I/O (2-10x slower than in-line values)
- **Backup/restore time**: Large TOAST tables significantly increase backup duration (hours → days for 1TB+ tables)
- **Maintenance overhead**: Autovacuum struggles with high TOAST churn, leading to bloat

**Real-world impact**: A service storing full API request/response logs in JSONB columns accumulates 500GB of TOAST data over 6 months. Backups take 8 hours instead of 2. Query latency increases from 50ms to 300ms. Moving old data to S3 reduces storage by 80% and improves backup time to 2.5 hours.

**Prevention cost**: 2-4 hours to implement data retention + external storage
**Reactive fix cost**: 24-48 hours of emergency optimization + application changes + data migration

**toast-ratio**: when most of a table lives in TOAST, every fetch of a wide value pays extra page reads
through the TOAST index, the main table's size understates the real I/O and backup weight, and cache is spent
on blob chunks. These are the tables where retention policies, S3 offload, or column splits pay off most, and
where compression choices (see compression-algorithm) move real gigabytes.

**compression-algorithm**: pglz spends roughly 5x more CPU compressing and 2-3x more decompressing than lz4, for a
compression ratio only a few percent better. On TOAST-heavy tables that is measurable write overhead and a
slower read of every large JSON/text value.

**compression-default**: every column without an explicit compression setting follows this GUC at write time — on
pglz, each of them pays the pglz CPU tax on every TOAST write and read. One parameter-group change
(`default_toast_compression = lz4`) migrates all new writes with no DDL, no locks, no downtime, and reverts
the same way.

- lz4 compresses ~5x faster and decompresses ~2-3x faster than pglz; ratio is slightly worse (a few % larger).
- Net effect: less CPU on TOAST-heavy writes and faster reads of large JSON/text values.
- pglz remains the PostgreSQL default only because lz4 is a build-time option; every RDS build has it.

## What is TOAST?

PostgreSQL uses TOAST to handle values that exceed the page size (~8KB):

**How TOAST works:**
1. Values larger than ~2KB are compressed using pglz or lz4 algorithms
2. If compressed value still exceeds ~2KB, it's stored out-of-line in a separate TOAST table
3. Main table row stores only a pointer (toast_pointer) to the TOAST data
4. When querying, PostgreSQL fetches TOAST data on-demand

**Storage strategies (per column):**

PostgreSQL offers four storage strategies that control how large values are handled:

- **`EXTENDED`** (default for text, jsonb, json, bytea)
  - Compress first using the configured algorithm (pglz or lz4)
  - If still >~2KB after compression, move to TOAST table
  - **Best for**: Most use cases—provides both compression and out-of-line storage
  - **Trade-off**: CPU cost for compression, but saves storage and I/O

- **`EXTERNAL`**
  - Store out-of-line in TOAST table WITHOUT compression
  - **Best for**: Pre-compressed data (images, gzipped files, videos)
  - **Trade-off**: Saves CPU (no compression), but uses more storage
  - **Use when**: Data is already compressed or incompressible

- **`MAIN`**
  - Compress but prefer to keep in main table (avoid TOAST)
  - Only goes to TOAST if absolutely necessary
  - **Best for**: Frequently accessed values <8KB
  - **Trade-off**: Larger main table pages, slower table scans
  - **Use when**: Most values fit after compression, avoid TOAST overhead

- **`PLAIN`**
  - No compression, no TOAST (must fit in main table)
  - **Used for**: Fixed-size types (integers, timestamps, booleans)
  - **Cannot be changed**: Not applicable to variable-length types

**Compression algorithms (PostgreSQL 14+):**

- **`default`** (no explicit setting)
  - Uses `pglz` for compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions
  - Applies to all columns with EXTENDED or MAIN storage
  - **Performance**: Slower compression/decompression
  - **Ratio**: 2-3x compression for typical data

- **`lz4`** (recommended for PostgreSQL 14+)
  - Modern, fast compression algorithm
  - **Performance**: 3-5x faster than pglz
  - **Ratio**: 2-4x compression (often better than pglz)
  - **Best for**: JSON, logs, text data
  - Set with: `ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c SET COMPRESSION lz4;`

- **`pglz`** (legacy)
  - Original PostgreSQL compression algorithm
  - **Performance**: Slower, CPU-intensive
  - **Ratio**: 2-3x compression
  - **When to use**: Rarely—only for compatibility with older PG versions

**What types use TOAST:**
- `text`, `varchar` (unlimited length)
- `jsonb`, `json`
- `bytea` (binary data)
- `array` types (if large)

## Subchecks

### toast-ratio

Lists TOAST-heavy tables: TOAST >=50% of total size, or >=10GB absolute. Sorted by TOAST size.

**Severity**: INFO

### toast-bloat

Identifies TOAST tables with excessive dead tuples:
- **FAIL**: Dead tuples >50% (critical bloat, immediate action)
- **WARN**: Dead tuples >30% (autovacuum not keeping up)

**Why critical**: TOAST table bloat occurs when:
- Rows are updated/deleted but TOAST data isn't vacuumed
- Autovacuum thresholds too conservative for large tables
- High update frequency on columns with TOASTed values

**Impact**: Dead tuples in TOAST waste storage and slow sequential scans of TOAST data.

### compression-algorithm

Counts columns whose new writes still compress with pglz where lz4 is available (PostgreSQL 14+).
A column with no explicit `SET COMPRESSION` follows `default_toast_compression` at write time, so unset
columns on an lz4-default instance already write lz4 and are not counted. `EXTERNAL`/`PLAIN` storage never
compresses and is never counted.

**Severity**: INFO

### compression-default

Checks the cluster-wide `default_toast_compression` setting (PostgreSQL 14+).

**Severity**: WARN when not lz4

## How to Fix

### For `toast-ratio`

TOAST-heavy tables (>=50% ratio or >=10GB) indicate large values dominating storage. Solutions depend on data type:

**Find which column carries the TOAST.** The catalog exposes TOAST size per table, not per column, so
attribution costs a scan of the suspect columns — run it off-peak or on a replica:

```sql
-- Average stored size per candidate column; the largest is the TOAST driver
SELECT avg(pg_column_size(payload)) AS payload, avg(pg_column_size(content)) AS content FROM events;

-- Compression method actually applied to a column's values
SELECT pg_column_compression(payload), count(*) FROM events GROUP BY 1;
```

Once the driving column is known, the remedies are structural:
- **Side-table split**: move the wide value to a companion table keyed by the parent id, so hot-path reads
  never pull it in.
- **Explicit ORM select-lists**: drop `SELECT *`; a query that omits the wide column pays no TOAST fetch.
- **`SET STORAGE EXTERNAL`**: for already-compressed or incompressible data (images, gzipped blobs), skip the
  wasted compression pass.
- **External object store (S3)**: for true blobs, keep only a key reference in the row.

**For JSONB columns:**
```sql
-- Extract frequently-accessed fields to dedicated columns
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_type text
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (payload->>'event_type') STORED;

ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN user_id bigint
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS ((payload->>'user_id')::bigint) STORED;

-- Create indexes on extracted columns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON events(event_type);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON events(user_id);
```

**For large text/binary data:**
```sql
-- Option 1: Move to separate table (hot/cold split)
CREATE TABLE document_content (
  document_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content text COMPRESSION lz4
);

-- Option 2: Move to external storage (S3)
-- Store only S3 key reference
ALTER TABLE documents DROP COLUMN content;
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN content_s3_key text;
```

**For very large TOAST (>=10GB), add data retention:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Archive old data to S3
COPY (
  SELECT id, title, content, created_at
  FROM documents
  WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
) TO PROGRAM 'aws s3 cp - s3://archive-bucket/documents-2022.csv';

-- Step 2: Delete archived records
DELETE FROM documents WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

-- Step 3: Reclaim space
VACUUM documents;
```

### For `toast-bloat`

TOAST tables with >30% dead tuples need immediate vacuum and autovacuum tuning:

**Immediate fix:**
```sql
-- Manual vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM schema.table_name;
```

**Permanent fix: Tune autovacuum for high TOAST churn:**
```sql
-- Make autovacuum more aggressive for this table
ALTER TABLE schema.table_name
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05);  -- Vacuum at 5% dead tuples (default 20%)

-- For very large tables, use threshold instead of scale
ALTER TABLE schema.table_name
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 10000);  -- Vacuum after 10K dead tuples
```

**For severe bloat (>50%):**
```sql
-- VACUUM FULL rebuilds table, reclaims space
-- WARNING: Requires exclusive lock, plan maintenance window
VACUUM FULL schema.table_name;

-- Alternative: pg_repack (online rebuild, minimal locking)
pg_repack --table schema.table_name --no-order
```

### For `compression-algorithm`

Prefer flipping `default_toast_compression` (see compression-default) over per-column DDL;
for columns explicitly set to pglz, `ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c SET COMPRESSION lz4`. The columns worth
acting on first — those with over 1GiB of TOAST — are listed under `--detail debug`, each labeled with the
compression its new writes use.

Columns using default/pglz compression should use lz4 (PostgreSQL 14+):

```sql
-- Change compression algorithm to lz4
ALTER TABLE events ALTER COLUMN payload SET COMPRESSION lz4;
ALTER TABLE logs ALTER COLUMN message SET COMPRESSION lz4;

-- Existing rows still use old compression
-- Force recompression (requires rewrite, use during maintenance window)
VACUUM FULL events;  -- Exclusive lock! Plan carefully.

-- Or use pg_repack for minimal locking
pg_repack --table events --no-order
```

**For already-compressed data (images, videos, gzipped content):**
```sql
-- Disable compression, use EXTERNAL storage
ALTER TABLE media ALTER COLUMN file_data SET STORAGE EXTERNAL;
-- Stores out-of-line without compression, saving CPU
```

### For `compression-default`

**Adopting lz4**:
- `ALTER TABLE ... SET COMPRESSION lz4` is a catalog-only change: instant, safe, brief lock, no data rewrite.
- It applies to newly written values only. An UPDATE that modifies the column stores the new value as lz4;
  an UPDATE that leaves the column untouched keeps its existing pglz datum indefinitely.
- Mixed compression within a column is fully supported: each datum records its own method and reads work forever.
- Reverting is the same operation in reverse (`SET COMPRESSION pglz`), again affecting new writes only.
- `VACUUM FULL`/`CLUSTER` do not reliably recompress existing out-of-line TOAST datums; reclaiming existing
  TOAST needs `pg_repack` or a dump/restore.
- Only incompatibility: a dump restored onto a server built without lz4 (never RDS) cannot read lz4 datums.
- Fleet alternative: `default_toast_compression = lz4` in the parameter group switches every unset column's
  new writes without any DDL.

**After switching**:
- Existing TOAST datums keep their old method; only new writes change. To recompress existing data use
  `pg_repack` or dump/restore — `VACUUM FULL`/`CLUSTER` do not reliably recompress out-of-line datums.
- The catalog records settings, not data. To see a table's real pglz/lz4 mix, run the (scan-priced)
  `SELECT pg_column_compression(col), count(*) FROM tab GROUP BY 1;`

## Decision Tree: Which Issue to Fix First?

```
CRITICAL (Fix immediately - hours of backup time or $$$ storage):
├─► toast-bloat >50% (wasting storage, degrading performance)
└─► toast-ratio >80% with >50GB total size

HIGH PRIORITY (Plan fix within 2-4 weeks):
├─► toast-bloat >30% (autovacuum issues)
└─► toast-ratio >=10GB TOAST with >100K inserts/day

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Plan within quarter):
├─► toast-ratio 1-10GB TOAST (monitor growth rate)
└─► compression-algorithm using pglz (easy fix, performance improvement)

LOW PRIORITY (Monitor, optimize opportunistically):
└─► All other TOAST usage <30% ratio and <1GB absolute size
```

**Rule of thumb**: Prioritize by multiplication of (TOAST size in GB) × (growth rate). A 5GB table growing 1GB/week is higher priority than a 50GB table growing 100MB/week.

## Optimization Strategies

### For JSONB Columns

**Problem**: Large JSON documents (>5KB average) causing TOAST overhead.

**Solution 1: Extract frequently-accessed fields**
```sql
-- Before: Every query fetches entire JSONB document
SELECT * FROM events WHERE payload->>'event_type' = 'purchase';

-- After: Extract hot fields to dedicated columns
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_type text
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (payload->>'event_type') STORED;

ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN user_id bigint
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS ((payload->>'user_id')::bigint) STORED;

-- Now query uses indexed column, avoids TOAST fetch
SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_type = 'purchase';
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON events(event_type);
```

**Solution 2: Strip nulls and unnecessary data**
```sql
-- JSONB stores nulls explicitly, wasting space
-- Strip nulls on insert/update
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION strip_nulls_trigger()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.payload = jsonb_strip_nulls(NEW.payload);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER strip_nulls_before_insert
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON events
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION strip_nulls_trigger();
```

**Solution 3: Partial indexes instead of full GIN**
```sql
-- Before: Full GIN index on entire JSONB (expensive, large)
CREATE INDEX ON events USING GIN (payload);

-- After: Partial index on specific paths
CREATE INDEX ON events((payload->>'status'))
  WHERE payload->>'status' IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- Index only commonly-queried values, ignore rare ones
```

### For Large Text/Binary Data

**Problem**: Storing full documents, logs, or binary files in database.

**Solution 1: Move to separate table**
```sql
-- Split hot metadata from cold content
-- Before: Single table with large content column
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  content text  -- Large, rarely accessed
);

-- After: Separate hot and cold data
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  created_at timestamptz
  -- content moved out
);

CREATE TABLE document_content (
  document_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content text COMPRESSION lz4
);

-- Query metadata without fetching content
SELECT id, title FROM documents WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Fetch content only when needed
SELECT dc.content FROM documents d
JOIN document_content dc ON dc.document_id = d.id
WHERE d.id = 123;
```

**Solution 2: External storage (S3, CloudFront)**
```sql
-- Store only reference to external object
ALTER TABLE documents DROP COLUMN content;
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN content_s3_key text;
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN content_size_bytes bigint;

-- Application uploads to S3, stores key
INSERT INTO documents (title, content_s3_key, content_size_bytes)
VALUES ('Report.pdf', 'documents/2024/report-abc123.pdf', 5242880);

-- Fetch from S3 when needed (application-level)
```

**Solution 3: Implement data retention**
```sql
-- Archive old data to cold storage
-- Step 1: Identify old records
SELECT id, created_at, pg_column_size(content) AS size_bytes
FROM documents
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Step 2: Export to archive (CSV, Parquet, S3)
COPY (
  SELECT id, title, content, created_at
  FROM documents
  WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
) TO PROGRAM 'aws s3 cp - s3://archive-bucket/documents-2022.csv';

-- Step 3: Delete archived records
DELETE FROM documents WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

-- Step 4: Reclaim space
VACUUM documents;
```

### PostgreSQL 14+ Compression Options

**Problem**: Default pglz compression is CPU-intensive and not very effective.

**Solution: Use LZ4 compression (PostgreSQL 14+)**
```sql
-- LZ4 is faster and compresses better than pglz for most workloads
ALTER TABLE events ALTER COLUMN payload SET COMPRESSION lz4;
ALTER TABLE logs ALTER COLUMN message SET COMPRESSION lz4;

-- Existing rows still use old compression
-- Force recompression (requires rewrite, use during maintenance window)
VACUUM FULL events;  -- Exclusive lock! Plan carefully.

-- Or use pg_repack for minimal locking
pg_repack --table events --no-order
```

**Compression comparison:**
| Algorithm | Speed         | Ratio       | Best For                      |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `pglz`    | Slow          | 2-3x        | Default, legacy compatibility |
| `lz4`     | Very fast     | 2-4x        | JSON, logs, text (recommended)|
| `none`    | N/A           | 1x          | Pre-compressed data (images)  |

**When to disable compression:**
```sql
-- For already-compressed data (images, videos, gzipped content)
ALTER TABLE media ALTER COLUMN file_data SET STORAGE EXTERNAL;
-- Stores out-of-line without compression, saving CPU
```

### For TOAST Bloat

**Problem**: Dead tuples accumulating in TOAST tables, wasting space.

**Immediate fix:**
```sql
-- Manual vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM schema.table_name;

-- Check if autovacuum is running
SELECT schemaname, relname, last_autovacuum, last_vacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname || '.' || relname = 'schema.table_name';
```

**Permanent fix: Tune autovacuum**
```sql
-- For tables with high TOAST churn, make autovacuum more aggressive
ALTER TABLE schema.table_name
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05);  -- Vacuum at 5% dead tuples (default 20%)

-- For very large tables, use threshold instead of scale
ALTER TABLE schema.table_name
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 10000);  -- Vacuum after 10K dead tuples

-- Monitor improvement
SELECT schemaname, relname, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname || '.' || relname = 'schema.table_name';
```

**For severe bloat (>50%):**
```sql
-- VACUUM FULL rebuilds table, reclaims space
-- WARNING: Requires exclusive lock, plan maintenance window
VACUUM FULL schema.table_name;

-- Alternative: pg_repack (online rebuild, minimal locking)
pg_repack --table schema.table_name --no-order
```

## Common Questions

**Q: What does "default" compression mean?**
A: `default` means no explicit compression algorithm has been set, so PostgreSQL uses pglz for backward compatibility.

Check what compression your columns are using:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL 14+: Check compression settings
SELECT
  attname AS column_name,
  CASE attcompression
    WHEN 'p' THEN 'pglz'
    WHEN 'l' THEN 'lz4'
    ELSE 'default (pglz)'
  END AS compression_algorithm,
  CASE attstorage
    WHEN 'p' THEN 'PLAIN'
    WHEN 'e' THEN 'EXTERNAL'
    WHEN 'x' THEN 'EXTENDED'
    WHEN 'm' THEN 'MAIN'
  END AS storage_strategy
FROM pg_attribute
WHERE attrelid = 'schema.table_name'::regclass
  AND attnum > 0
  AND NOT attisdropped
ORDER BY attnum;
```

To see actual compression in stored data:
```sql
-- Check compression of actual data values (PostgreSQL 14+)
SELECT attname, pg_column_compression(attname::regclass::text) AS actual_compression
FROM pg_attribute
WHERE attrelid = 'schema.table_name'::regclass AND attnum > 0;
```

**Q: What's the difference between EXTENDED and EXTERNAL storage?**
A: Both move large values to TOAST tables, but handle compression differently:
- **EXTENDED**: Compresses first, then TOASTs if still large (uses CPU, saves storage)
- **EXTERNAL**: TOASTs without compression (saves CPU, uses more storage)

Use EXTERNAL for pre-compressed data (images, gzipped files) to avoid wasting CPU on already-compressed data.

**Q: Should I move all large data to S3?**
A: It depends on access patterns:
- **Keep in DB**: Frequently accessed, transactional data, <1MB per row
- **Move to S3**: Rarely accessed, archival, >1MB per row, binary files (images, PDFs)
- **Hybrid**: Recent data in DB, old data in S3 with lifecycle rules

**Q: What's the performance impact of TOASTed values?**
A: Fetching TOASTed values requires additional I/O:
- In-line value: 1 page read
- TOASTed value: 1 page read (main table) + 1-100 page reads (TOAST table)
- **Impact**: 2-10x slower for `SELECT *` queries, no impact if column not selected

**Q: Does TOAST affect all queries?**
A: No. TOAST is fetched on-demand:
```sql
-- No TOAST fetch (payload not selected)
SELECT id, event_type FROM events WHERE user_id = 123;

-- TOAST fetch (payload selected)
SELECT * FROM events WHERE user_id = 123;
```

**Q: How do I monitor TOAST growth over time?**
A: Track TOAST size with a scheduled query:
```sql
-- Save to monitoring table
CREATE TABLE toast_size_history (
  recorded_at timestamptz DEFAULT NOW(),
  schema_name text,
  table_name text,
  toast_size_bytes bigint
);

-- Run daily
INSERT INTO toast_size_history (schema_name, table_name, toast_size_bytes)
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_relation_size(schemaname || '.' || tablename || '_toast')
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

-- Analyze growth
SELECT table_name,
       toast_size_bytes / 1024^3 AS toast_gb,
       (toast_size_bytes - LAG(toast_size_bytes) OVER (PARTITION BY table_name ORDER BY recorded_at))
         / 1024^3 AS growth_gb
FROM toast_size_history
ORDER BY recorded_at DESC;
```

**Q: Can I prevent TOAST entirely?**
A: For small values, yes:
```sql
-- Use MAIN storage to avoid out-of-line storage
ALTER TABLE events ALTER COLUMN payload SET STORAGE MAIN;
-- Values up to ~8KB stay in-line (compressed)
-- Larger values still go to TOAST

-- Trade-off: Larger main table pages, slower updates
-- Only use if most values <8KB
```

**Q: What's the relationship between TOAST and table bloat?**
A: They're related but separate:
- **Table bloat**: Dead tuples in main table (fixed by VACUUM)
- **TOAST bloat**: Dead tuples in TOAST table (fixed by VACUUM on main table)
- Updating/deleting rows with TOASTed values creates bloat in BOTH tables
- Check autovacuum settings if both are bloated

**Q: Should I use JSONB or separate columns?**
A: Hybrid approach is usually best:
```sql
-- Hot fields: Separate columns (fast, indexed)
-- Cold fields: JSONB (flexible, rarely queried)
CREATE TABLE events (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type text NOT NULL,        -- Hot: frequently queried
  user_id bigint NOT NULL,          -- Hot: frequently queried
  metadata jsonb,                   -- Cold: rare queries, variable schema
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL   -- Hot: frequently filtered
);

-- Fast queries on indexed columns
CREATE INDEX ON events(event_type, created_at);
-- Flexible schema for metadata
```
