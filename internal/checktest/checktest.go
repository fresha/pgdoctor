// AssertSeverityInvariant verifies the severity contract established by
// check.NewReport and check.Report.AddFinding: the report severity is the
// maximum finding severity (never below SeverityPass), and no table row is
// more severe than the finding that contains it.
//
// A check whose findings are all SKIP is the one exception: it could not run at
// all, so it reports SKIP rather than being floored up to PASS. AddFinding only
// raises severity and SKIP sorts below PASS, so such a check assigns
// Report.Severity directly. Runner-injected SKIP reports take the same shape.
